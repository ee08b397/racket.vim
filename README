USE  https://github.com/wlangstroth/vim-racket --
Use racket.vim from this package (and probably the rest of the package)

It works with scribble.vim (vimscript #3756)

This is a cheap and cheerful syntax for racket's "scheme" language.

It's just to get me off the ground, and it borrows heavily from (using

It's very much a works-for-me script.
As it grows, I'll share.

This syntax was written to smooth over some bumps for scribble.vim
(vimscript #3756)
